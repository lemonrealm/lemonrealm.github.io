### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
        This lab was especially my favorite because of the fact that it was a fun little game that we played in class. Part 2 was where it was created and executed. I believe that the game was super simple yet super fun to play. Accomplishing this small task made me enjoy computer science and is permanently stuck in my head.

  Lab 7
        Lab 7 part 2 was where we made a blackjack game and is one I enjoyed fairly well. Although the lab was kind of diffucult but it brought about a sense of excitement when it was completed and actaully worked out. I am so happy to expeirance this lab in the fullest.

  Lab 8 
        Lab 8 part 3 was particularly enjoyable because of the fact that I created an animation that was played out on my laptop. This lab stood out in the most peculiar way because it was very different from the previous labs. I enjoyed this one very much and hope to see more of these in the future.
